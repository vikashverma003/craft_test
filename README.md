Rolling Back Migrations
To rollback the latest migration operation, you may use the rollback command. This command rolls back the last "batch" of migrations, which may include multiple migration files:

php artisan migrate:rollback
You may rollback a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the rollback command. For example, the following command will rollback the last five migrations:

php artisan migrate:rollback --step=5


The migrate:reset command will roll back all of your application's migrations:
php artisan migrate:reset
*/
Rollback & Migrate In Single Command
The migrate:refresh command will roll back all of your migrations and then execute the migrate command. This command effectively re-creates your entire database:
php artisan migrate:refresh

php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
You may rollback & re-migrate a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the refresh command. For example, the following command will rollback & re-migrate the last five migrations:

php artisan migrate:refresh --step=5

php artisan migrate:fresh

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
